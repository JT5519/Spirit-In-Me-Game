        SPIRIT IN ME (recomended resolution: 1920x1080)(scroll down)
                    

        TIPS: 
        -> Go through case files for better understanding the story
        -> Go through config to set mouse Y axis and understand your role as a hunter

        CONTACT: 
        -> I extensively tested the game and eliminated what I believe is all the bugs
	-> If you notice something you think is a bug/glitch/should-not-be-happening, would greatly
	   appreciate being informed. Email: joel.sk10@gmail.com
	
	NOTE:
	-> This game is hosted on a GitHub Static page, which cannot take files larger than 100 mb
	-> Due to memory limitations, I have removed some components of the game that added to the aesthetics and ambience
	-> The original sized game is available on my GitHub: JT5519/Spirit-In-Me/Original Game

        Thank you for playing my game.
